# Instrument Recognition Web App
This is a machine learning project that aims to implement a multi-class classifier that identifies instruments in music streams. Our model consists of a CNN whichâ€™s input is an audio stream that we pre-process to extract the mel-spectogram, and outputs the dominance or non-dominance of pre-selected instruments. 

Our focus was to study on 10 instruments, and thus classify audio streams into one of those classes.

The instruments are as follows:-
Acoustic guitar, Bass drum, Cello, Clarinet, Double bass, Flute, Hi hat, Saxophone, Snare drum and Voilin.

I have used 'streamlit' to build the front-end of the application.
